### Hi, I'm Alfonso Miranda ðŸ‘‹

I'm an software engineer, specialized in mobile development, and more specifically in iOS.
I've always loved developing software for as long as I can remember. I started playing with my Spectrum at age 11 and ended up programming in BASIC, and I haven't been able to stop until today.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on iOS development project.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SwiftUI and Combine.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about swift, objective-c or iOS development.
